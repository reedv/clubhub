Overview
The problem: UH Manoa has over 200 Registered Independent Organizations, plus many more that do not have this “official” status but are nonetheless active organizations. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for students to learn (a) what student clubs (both registered and unregistered) exist, what they do, and how to get further involved.

The solution: The Club Hub application will provide a centralized directory for UH Manoa student clubs. UH Manoa students can login to browse a well organized directory of all current student clubs, with brief descriptions, meeting times and locations, URLs to their websites (if any), contact information for officers, and a few select photos.

Club Hub has three user roles, all of whom login with their UH ID. Regular users browse the directory. Admins make sure site content is appropriate and grant “club admin” privileges to selected users. Club Admins have the ability to edit the data associated with their club.

The site should not simply support browsing by a list of clubs in alphabetical order, but should also allow filtering by interest area. For example, “athletic” clubs, “art” clubs, “music” clubs, etc. A club can belong to multiple interest areas.

Users can specify interest areas, and be notified when a new club is created matching that interest area (or an existing club adds that interest area).

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, create new categories of musical tastes, capabilities, and goals, and ban inappropriate users who violate the Terms of Use.

Upon first login, all users must agree to Terms of Use before they obtain access to the system.



* Good interface model would be the porn web site fapality.com (simple and intuitive)
** cards can be implemented with the semantic UI (SUI) (fluid) card view (can use hidden image variation to create on-hover slideshows for each card, cards can link to the club web site)
** can use simple ui menu container for top menu
** logins can be used to allow users to manage their club profiles

* should think of what info will be required for club profiles on the site
** name
** keywords (how to enforce keeping keywords actually relevant to the clubs?)
** 

* Possible pages
** Public Landing page
** Login page (may be part of public landing page)
** User home page
** Admin home page
** Club admin home page. (try similar to individual linkdin profile home page)
** Browse clubs by interest area(s).

* Layout / behavior of pages is is going to be mainly decided by whether the site is going to be a connection pt. for people to find out about different clubs OR a social platform for people to communicate among their clubs (which is not seem very much in line with the stated goal of the project).
